<p>
I am a Lecturer in the Institute for Applied Computational Science (IACS) at Harvard University where I conduct research and
teach classes. My research is at the intersection of applied mathematics, physics, and machine learning with an emphasis on
fluid mechanics and multiscale phenomena. At IACS, I teach classes on basic software principles (CS207), high performance
computing (CS205, AC290r), and fluid mechanics (ES123). I have also led a version of the capstone course (AC297r) which
requires students to work closely with industrial and academic partners to solve real-world problems.
