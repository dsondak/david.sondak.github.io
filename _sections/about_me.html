I am a Research and Development Software Engineer in the Physics Theory and Modeling group at Dassault Systemes Simulia Corp.
Prior to this, I was a Lecturer in Computational Science in the Institute for Applied Computational Science (IACS) at Harvard
University where I conducted research and taught classes. My research is at the intersection of applied mathematics, physics,
and machine learning with an emphasis on fluid mechanics and multiscale phenomena. At IACS, I taught classes on basic
software principles (CS207), high performance computing (CS205, AC290r), and fluid mechanics (ES123). I also led a version of
the capstone course (AC297r) which requires students to work closely with industrial and academic partners to solve
real-world problems.
