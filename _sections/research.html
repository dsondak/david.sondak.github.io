<h2> Multiscale Physical Systems </h2>

<img src="assets/imgs/T_Ra1T.png" alt="drawing" style="width=512px;height=256px;"/> <br>
<p style="text-align: left"> Multiscale phenomena are common in everyday life and engineering systems.  Fluid systems in particular exhibit multiple
spatial and temporal scales.  The quintessential example of a multiscale phenomenon in fluid mechanics is turbulence --- the
disordered, seemingly random, motion of a fast-moving fluid.  Much of my research in this area has focused on developing
turbulence models for a variety of fluid systems including Rayleigh-Benard convection and magnetohydrodynamics.  I have also
found exact coherent structures in Rayleigh-Benard convection that optimize heat transport and provide an upper bound on the
actual turbulent heat transport.  Ongoing research aims to find the signature of these optimal solutions in actual turbulent
flows.  The emerging field of machine learning is a good candidate to search for such solutions.  An aim of my future
research is to apply and extend these models to complex physical systems including geophysical flows (e.g.
magnetoconvection). </p>

<h2> Data-Driven Modeling and Machine Learning </h2>

<p style="text-align: left">
At the heart of research in multiscale phenomena and fluid mechanics is the desire to find reliable, reduced models that can
be used to make predictions of scientific and engineering interest.  New statistical algorithms emerging from the machine
learning community provide a new perspective on developing turbulence models.  Developing new machine learning models
provides an avenue to perform computations with data and understand the effects of uncertainties in models and their
prediction.  My primary focus in this area has been on how to build physics into data-driven algorithms.  This approach has
the benefit of leading to more reliable predictions in parameter regimes for which data is unavailable and better-performing
algorithms.
