<!--  My research is motivated by fluid
flows in complex systems including astrophysical and engineering systems.  Of particular interest is the development of
computationally tractable models that can capture essential physical processes.  To accomplish this, my research focuses on
the development of a wide variety of algorithms.  These include traditional approaches such as large eddy simulation and
Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes through modern data-driven approaches involving machine learning algorithms such as neural
networks.
