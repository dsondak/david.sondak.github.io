<p>
I am a Lecturer in the Institute for Applied Computational Science (IACS) at Harvard University where I conduct research and teach
classes.
</p>

<p>
My research is at the intersection of applied mathematics, physics, and machine learning with an emphasis on fluid
mechanics and multiscale phenomena.
</p>

<p>
At IACS, I teach classes on basic software principles (CS207) and extreme computing
(AC290r).  I have also led a version of the capstone course (AC297r) which requires students to work closely with industrial
and academic partners to solve real-world problems.
